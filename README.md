## üåï What is a MoonBoard?

The MoonBoard is a standardized, interactive climbing wall that connects a global community of climbers through shared problems and competitive performance rankings.
Each MoonBoard is built with identical specifications, including a grid of holds and an LED system, allowing climbers worldwide to train on the same problems.

## üîç Reverse Engineering the MoonBoard Protocol

To integrate gaming functionalities, we reverse-engineered the MoonBoard's BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) communication protocol. The protocol structure is as follows:

- **Header**: `l#`
- **Pixel Commands**: A sequence of color-coded pixel updates
- **End Marker**: `#`

Each pixel command includes:

- **Color Identifier**:
  - `S` = Green
  - `P` = Blue
  - `E` = Red
- **Pixel Index**: A number between 0 and 197 indicating the pixel‚Äôs position

The LED grid is an 11-column by 18-row matrix (198 pixels total), with a zigzag indexing pattern:

- Pixel 0 is at the bottom-left corner.
- Indexing alternates direction column by column.

- **Live Control**: Manage gameplay directly from the app.
- **Board Display**: Visual feedback rendered on the MoonBoard screen via BLE.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the App

To build the app for Android:

### Using EAS Build

Ensure you have EAS CLI installed and configured. Then run:

```bash
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

This command creates a production-ready `.aab` file suitable for distribution on the Google Play Store.

### Using Expo CLI for Development

For development purposes, you can run the app on an Android device or emulator:

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

This command builds and installs the app directly onto your connected Android device or emulator.
